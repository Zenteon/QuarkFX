**Quark Shaders for ReShade**
Quark is a repository of efficient and high quality shaders meant to adhere closely to physical methods while maintaining a consistent artistic vision, and ignoring the restricting limitations of DirectX9.
If you do wish to use Quark Shaders in older Dx9 games, it's recommended to use a wrapper such as DXVK or dgVoodoo2.

**Current Effects**
Xenon Bloom:
Xenon Bloom is an artistic bloom meant to provide excellent point precision and ranges without overpowering the image.
It uses a mixture of physically based and catered methods to create dramatic, but pleasing results.
