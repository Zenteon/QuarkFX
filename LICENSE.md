### TERMS AND CONDITIONS


0. Definitions.


"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.


"The Project" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees", "users" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.


"The Author" or "Original Author" refers to the original creator of this project and its
source code.


To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.


A "covered work" means either the unmodified Project or a work based
on the Project.


To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.


To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.


To "contribute" refers to offering any form of material held to copyright to
be used in the project.
This could be in any way, such as, but not limited to: pull requests, explicitly
sharing it with the author or giving permission for the use of it.
